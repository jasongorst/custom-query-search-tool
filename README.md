# Custom Query Search Tool

#### This application is a form coded in JavaScript that allows the user to create a custom search query, fetches the selected transaction data from a back-end API, and formats and presents this data in a table.

This project was created by [Jason Gorst](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jason-gorst/) during a micro-internship
with [Open Avenues Foundation](https://www.openavenuesfoundation.org) in cooperation
with [Delaget](https://www.delaget.com) under the supervision
of [Vaclav Hasenohrl](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vaclav-hasenohrl-399431116/).

It was created with [React](https://reactjs.org), utilizing the [React integration](https://react.semantic-ui.com)
for [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com). Other libraries used directly
include [React Router](https://reactrouter.com),
[semantic-ui-calendar-react](https://github.com/arfedulov/semantic-ui-calendar-react), [Moment](https://momentjs.com),
and [JSURL](https://github.com/Sage/jsurl).

The source code is available on [Github](https://github.com/jasongorst/custom-query-search-tool), and is released under
the [MIT License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/).

After the project was completed, I later reimplemented Vaclav's back-end API as a Rails API-only app. This build of the
custom search query tool calls my API implementation. That API server source code is also available
on [Github](https://github.com/jasongorst/custom-query-search-tool-api).
